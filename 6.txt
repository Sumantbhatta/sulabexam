Procedures for 6.txt: Transfer Files Between VMs
Prerequisites:

Two operational VMs (VM1 and VM2).

Basic familiarity with the VM operating systems.

Network connectivity between both VMs.

Steps:

Establish Network Connectivity:

Ensure both VMs are on the same network or can communicate online.

Check the IP addresses of both VMs.

Choose a File Transfer Method:

Options include FTP, SCP, or shared drives.

This guide uses SCP (Secure Copy Protocol).

Install SCP Client:

On Windows VMs, use an app like WinSCP.

On Linux VMs, SCP is usually pre-installed.

Preparing Files for Transfer:

On VM1, locate the files you want to transfer.

You can compress them into a zip file for easier transfer (optional).

Using SCP for Transfer:

Open the SCP client on VM1.

Enter the IP address of VM2.

Provide authentication (username/password).

Browse and select the file(s) on VM1.

Choose the target directory on VM2.

Initiate the transfer.

Verifying Transfer:

Log into VM2.

Check the target directory to ensure files are present.

Verify file integrity (size, no corruption).

Troubleshooting:

If it fails, check network connectivity and credentials.

Ensure enough storage space on VM2.

Check firewall or security settings.

Alternative Methods:

For non-technical users, use a shared network drive or cloud storage.

Upload from VM1 and download to VM2.
