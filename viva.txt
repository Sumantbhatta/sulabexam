CLOUD COMPUTING VIVA NOTES

1. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing refers to delivering computing services (servers, storage, networking, databases, software) over the internet on pay-per-use basis.
Example: Google Drive stores files online instead of on your local computer.

2. What is CloudSim?
CloudSim is a simulation toolkit for modeling cloud environments and testing cloud algorithms before actual deployment.
Example: Testing VM allocation algorithms in a simulated cloud environment.

3. What is Fog Computing?
Fog computing is an extension of cloud computing where processing happens near the source of data instead of sending everything to the cloud.
Example: Smart traffic lights analyzing vehicle data locally.

4. What are the 3 types of Services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)?
IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service (e.g., AWS EC2 virtual machines).
PaaS – Platform as a Service (e.g., Google App Engine for app development).
SaaS – Software as a Service (e.g., Gmail).

5. What are the 3 types of Cloud (Public, Private, Hybrid)?
Public Cloud – shared infrastructure (AWS).
Private Cloud – owned by organization (bank).
Hybrid Cloud – combination of both.

6. What are the main characteristics of Cloud?
On‑demand access, scalability, pay-as-you-go, elasticity, measured usage.

7. What is Elasticity in Cloud Computing?
Ability to automatically scale resources up/down.
Example: E-commerce site auto-scales during festival sale.

8. What is Simulation?
Creating a virtual model to test something without doing it in real life.
Example: Flight simulators used for pilot training.

9. What is Hadoop?
Hadoop is an open-source framework used to store and process Big Data in a distributed manner.
Example: Facebook uses Hadoop to analyze user data.

10. What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and query relational databases.
Example: SELECT * FROM students;

11. What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is creating multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine.

12. What is Virtual Machine (VM) and how to access it?
A VM is a software-based computer running inside a real computer. Access through Hypervisor like VMware, VirtualBox.

13. Why use Virtual Machines (VMs)?
Better resource utilization, isolation, multiple OS on same machine.

14. What is Structured, Unstructured, and Semi-structured data?
Structured – Tables (SQL databases).
Unstructured – Images, videos, audio.
Semi-structured – JSON, XML.

15. What is Big Data?
Huge data that cannot be processed by traditional systems.
Example: Social media data.

16. What are the disadvantages of Cloud Computing?
Internet dependency, security risks, less control.

17. Drive storage offered by Cloud Providers:
Google Drive – 15GB free
OneDrive – 5GB free
Dropbox – 2GB free

18. Difference: Cloud Computing vs Edge Computing
Cloud – processing happens in remote data centers.
Edge – processing happens near data source.

19. How does Cloud support IoT?
Stores IoT device data, remote monitoring.
Example: Smart home devices storing data to cloud.

20. What is Serverless Computing?
Allows developers to run code without managing servers.
Example: AWS Lambda.

21. Benefits of Cloud-based databases
Scalable, automatic backup, accessible anywhere.

22. Cloud impact on data security
Providers use encryption, firewalls, IAM access control.

23. Role of APIs in Cloud
APIs help integrate and communicate between software and cloud services.

24. What is Containerization?
Containerization packages applications with all dependencies into containers.
Example: Docker.

25. Cloud for AI/ML
Cloud provides GPUs/TPUs for training ML models.

26. What is Google App Engine?
A PaaS service to deploy applications without managing infrastructure.

27. What is TryStack?
TryStack is a free OpenStack cloud platform to practice cloud on virtual VMs.

28. How Hadoop is used in Cloud Computing?
Cloud platforms run Hadoop clusters to process Big Data quickly.
